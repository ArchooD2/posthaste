# posthaste â€“ Hastebin uploads, lightning fast

Based on [ylmcc/AutoHasteBin](https://github.com/ylmcc/AutoHastebin)

`posthaste` is a super-lightweight Python CLI tool for quickly uploading text or files to any Hastebin-compatible server â€” straight from your terminal.

Perfect for sharing code snippets, logs, notes, and more â€” without needing to open a browser. Pipe it, upload it, share it â€” done.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Upload directly from stdin or from one or more files
- Supports authentication tokens (optional)
- Save tokens to your environment for later use
- Choose your own Hastebin server
- No dependencies beyond `requests` and my [in-house `argparse` sub-in](https://github.com/ArchooD2/snaparg)
- Blazing fast and easy to use

---

## ðŸ“¦ Quick Start

- [`pip install posthaste`](https://pypi.org/project/posthaste/)

- then upload text:

```

- or upload a file:

```bash

```

- or upload multiple files:

- save your API token (only needed if the server requires it):

```
